## OUTLINE
---------------
The landing page serves as a central hub for visitors to access relevant information and resources related to the lab. It was created using Webflow, a cloud-based web design and development platform that allows users to design, build, and launch responsive websites without writing any code. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating websites, and it also offers a range of pre-built design elements and templates that users can customize to fit their needs.
